# Dark and Light mode - Astro

Very simple application where you can test the `light and dark mode` on your pages.

It was used:
- Astro v2.0
- TypeScript
- astrojs/react
- astrojs/tailwind
- astrojs/compress
- Prettier

## âš™ Project Setup

### Dependencies
```
yarn
```

### Run

```
yarn dev
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
